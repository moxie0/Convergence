This file provides a brief overview of the installer for developers.

convergence-installer.py

	is the command-line callable for the user.  Heavy paramterisation
	of all things required for an install, including the OS type.

convergence_installer/

	the library that provides all the tools used by the command-line tool.


Classes in convergence_installer:

Base:

	Provides simple messaging and a few file operation primitives

	Is the base class for all other classes.

Config(Base):

	Is provided the details from the command-line parser.  Holds them.
	Command-line args are verified using the verify() method.

Core(Base):

	Knows about the convergence-<blah>.py tools (gencert etc.) and uses
	them during the install.

OS(Base):

	The top level of the OS abstraction.  A whole bunch of members,
	and a few methods, are defined which need to be overridden by
	child classes.

	Also defines all of the routines for doing an install based on the
	members and methods which are overridden in the child classes.

sysv_nix(OS):

	Defines the members that are thought to be common for System V
	versions of Linux.  E.g install service init script to 
	/etc/rc.d/init.d

RHEL6(sysv_nix):

	Specifices of the members and methods for RHEL6 (and recent
	Fedora Core).
