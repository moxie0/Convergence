The 'installer' area is for the development of an installer that 
will do as much as possible for a person who wishes to run a 
Convergence Notary.

INTENTION
---------

The idea is that the would-be Notary 'runner' runs one install 
script with all data required provided on the command-line.

The installer then does the rest, leaving the 'runner' with only
a little to do: publish the bundle, check local security.

LIMITATIONS
-----------

The current environment uses two components that require human
interaction: the certificate generator, and the bundle generator.

The first is understandable.  The second can/should be 'auto-generated'
so that the human does not need to enter the same data again.

STATUS
------

This installer is only operational on RedHat Enterprise Linux 6
(and recent Fedora Core) release(s).  It needs to embrace as many
Linux distributions as possible, and Windows OSes (and onwards
to BSD, MacOS etc.).
